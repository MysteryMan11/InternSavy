This repository contains the data science notebooks and datasets for my internship.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main folders:

- **Task_1:** Contains Jupyter notebooks with the Admission Prediction analyses, ML models and Dataset in CSV file for Task 1.

- **Task_2:** Contains Jupyter notebooks with the Clustering Models' analyses, Clustering models and Dataset in CSV file for Task 2.

- **Task_3:** Contains Jupyter notebooks with the Customer Segmentation analysis, ML models and Dataset in CSV file for Task 3.


## Notebooks

1. **Notebook 1 - Admission Prediction using Linear Regression & Ridge Regression:**
   - Filename: `t1.ipynb`
   - Description: This notebook implements linear regression and ridge regression models to predict admission outcomes based on various features. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Notebook 2 - Clustering Analysis of different algorithms on customer dataset:**
   - Filename: `t2.ipynb`
   - Description: This notebook explores clustering algorithms such as k-means, agglomerative hierarchy, spectral clustering, and mean shift on a customer dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model implementation, and visualization of clustering results.

3. **Notebook 3 - Customer Segmentation Analysis:**
   - Filename: `t3.ipynb`
   - Description: This notebook focuses on customer segmentation analysis. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of clustering techniques to identify distinct customer segments.


## Datasets

- **Dataset 1 - Admission Predict Ver1.1:**
  - Filename: `Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv`
  - Description: Dataset containing features related to admission predictions.

- **Dataset 2 - Mall Customers:**
  - Filename: `Mall_Customers.csv`
  - Description: Dataset used for clustering analysis to understand customer behavior in a mall.

- **Dataset 3 - Segmentation Data:**
  - Filename: `segmentation_data.csv`
  - Description: Dataset used for customer segmentation analysis to identify distinct customer segments.


## Tech Stack

This project is developed using the following technologies:

- **Python 3.x:** The primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning.

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Utilized for interactive and exploratory coding.

- **Libraries:** Various Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.
